# IBM

• Contributed to the development and architecture of a new inventory system tool for IBM that contained over 2.5 million systems and pulled in
several thousand new records daily
• Implemented API gateway using API Connect to route end‑user to microservices as well as provide a secure layer for all our microservices
• Improved search by adding Elasticsearch functionality and service
• Implemented a Python scheduler that pulled systems daily from other internal services, transformed the data and saved them into our own
Cloudant NoSQL database
• Worked on Kafka stream implementations to push out changes to different sources of truth and keep our inventory and theirs in sync
