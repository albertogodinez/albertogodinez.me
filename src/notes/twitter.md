# Teacher Retirement System of Texas

- Shipped rebuild of ads.twitter.com Reporting dashboard using Twitter’s modern stack such as Scala, GraphQL, and React Hooks. Migrating from the previous legacy Scala service to the managed Graphql APIs helped the team reduce operational overhead
- Rebuild also included the migration of 17,000 advertiser accounts to the new Reporting Dashboard improving overall customer satisfaction
- Participated in 24/7 one-week on‑call rotation. Engaged with customers to discover and debug issues and discuss with product managers to add feature requests to the roadmap as well as prioritize issues that came up
- Rebuild how we create and expose presets for ad metrics within our data access and GraphQL layer leading to an 80% reduction in future code pull requests
